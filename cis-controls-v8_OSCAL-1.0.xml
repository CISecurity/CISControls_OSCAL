  <title>Inventory and Control of Enterprise Assets</title>

  <part name="statement" id="cisc-1_stmt">
   <p>Actively manage (inventory, track, and correct) all enterprise assets (end-user devices,
    including portable and mobile; network devices; non-computing/Internet of Things (IoT) devices;
    and servers) connected to the infrastructure, physically, virtually, remotely, and those within
    cloud environments, to accurately know the totality of assets that need to be monitored and
    protected within the enterprise. This will also support identifying unauthorized and unmanaged
    assets to remove or remediate.</p>
  </part>
  <part name="guidance" id="cisc-1_gdn">
   <p>Enterprises cannot defend what they do not know they have. Managed control of all enterprise
    assets also plays a critical role in security monitoring, incident response, system backup, and
    recovery. Enterprises should know what data is critical to them, and proper asset management
    will help identify those enterprise assets that hold or manage this critical data, so
    appropriate security controls can be applied.</p>
   <p>External attackers are continuously scanning the internet address space of target enterprises,
    premise-based or in the cloud, identifying possibly unprotected assets attached to enterprises’
    networks. Attackers can take advantage of new assets that are installed, yet not securely
    configured and patched. Internally, unidentified assets can also have weak security
    configurations that can make them vulnerable to web or email-based malware; and adversaries can
    leverage weak security configurations for traversing the network, once they are inside.</p>
   <p>Additional assets that connect to the enterprise’s network (e.g., demonstration systems,
    temporary test systems, guest networks, etc.) should be identified and/or isolated, in order to
    prevent adversarial access from affecting the security of enterprise operations.</p>
   <p>Large, complex, dynamic enterprises understandably struggle with the challenge of managing
    intricate, fast-changing environments. However, attackers have shown the ability, patience, and
    willingness to “inventory and control” our enterprise assets at very large scale in order to
    support their opportunities.</p>
   <p>Another challenge is that portable end-user devices will periodically join a network and then
    disappear, making the inventory of currently available assets very dynamic. Likewise, cloud
    environments and virtual machines can be difficult to track in asset inventories when they are
    shut down or paused. Another benefit of complete enterprise asset management is supporting
    incident response. Both when investigating the origination of network traffic from an asset on
    the network, and to be able to identify all potentially vulnerable, or impacted, assets of
    similar type or location during an incident.</p>

  <title>Inventory and Control of Software Assets</title>

   <p>Actively manage (inventory, track, and correct) all software (operating systems and

  </part>
  <part name="guidance" id="cisc-2_gdn">
   <p>A complete software inventory is a critical foundation for preventing attacks. Attackers
    continuously scan target enterprises looking for vulnerable versions of software that can be
    remotely exploited. For example, if a user opens a malicious website or attachment with a
    vulnerable browser, an attacker can often install backdoor programs and bots that give the
    attacker long-term control of the system. Attackers can also use this access to move laterally
    through the network. One of the key defenses against these attacks is updating and patching
    software. However, without a complete inventory of software assets, an enterprise cannot
    determine if they have vulnerable software, or if there are potential licensing violations.</p>
   <p>Even if a patch is not yet available, a complete software inventory list allows an enterprise
    to guard against known attacks until the patch is released. Some sophisticated attackers use
    “zero-day exploits”, which take advantage of previously unknown vulnerabilities that have yet to
    have a patch released by the software vendor. Depending on the severity of the exploit, an
    enterprise can implement temporary mitigation measures to guard against attacks until the patch
    is released.</p>
   <p>Management of software assets is also important to identify unnecessary security risks. An
    enterprise should review their software inventory to identify any enterprise assets running
    software that is not needed for business purposes. For example, an enterprise asset may come
    installed with default software that creates a potential security risk and provides no benefit
    to the enterprise. It is critical to inventory, understand, assess, and manage all software
    connected to an enterprise’s infrastructure.</p>

   <p>Data is no longer only contained within an enterprise’s border, it is in the cloud, on
    portable end-user devices where users work from home, and is often shared with partners or
    online services who might have it anywhere in the world. In addition to sensitive data an
    enterprise holds related to finances, intellectual property, and customer data, there also might
    be numerous international regulations for protection of personal data. Data privacy has become
    increasingly important, and enterprises are learning that privacy is about the appropriate use
    and management of data, not just encryption. Data must be appropriately managed through its
    entire lifecycle. These privacy rules can be complicated for multi-national enterprises, of any
    size, however there are fundamentals that can apply to all.</p>
   <p>Once attackers have penetrated an enterprise’s infrastructure, one of their first tasks is to
    find and exfiltrate data. Enterprises might not be aware that sensitive data is leaving their
    environment because they are not monitoring data outflows.</p>
   <p>While many attacks occur on the network, others involve physical theft of portable end-user
    devices, attacks on service providers or other partners holding sensitive data. Other sensitive
    enterprise assets may also include non-computing devices that provide management and control of
    physical systems, such as Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems.</p>
   <p>The enterprise’s loss of control over protected or sensitive data is a serious and often
    reportable business impact. While some data is compromised or lost as a result of theft or
    espionage, the vast majority are a result of poorly understood data management rules, and user
    error. The adoption of data encryption, both in transit and at rest, can provide mitigation
    against data compromise, and more importantly, is a regulatory requirement for most controlled
    data.</p>

  </part>
  <part name="guidance" id="cisc-4_gdn">
   <p>As delivered from manufacturers and resellers, the default configurations for enterprise
    assets and software are normally geared towards ease-of-deployment and ease-of-use rather than
    security. Basic controls, open services and ports, default accounts or passwords, pre-configured
    Domain Name System (DNS) settings, older (vulnerable) protocols, and pre-installation of
    unnecessary software can all be exploitable if left in their default state. Further, these
    security configuration updates need to be managed and maintained over the life cycle of
    enterprise assets and software. Configuration updates need to be tracked and approved through
    configuration management workflow process to maintain a record that can be reviewed for
    compliance, leveraged for incident response, and to support audits. This CIS Control is
    important to on-premises devices, as well as remote devices, network devices, and cloud
    environments.</p>
   <p>Service providers play a key role in modern infrastructures, especially for smaller
    enterprises. They often are not set up by default in the most secure configuration to provide
    flexibility for their customers to apply their own security policies. Therefore, the presence of
    default accounts or passwords, excessive access, or unnecessary services are common in default
    configurations. These could introduce weaknesses that are under the responsibility of the
    enterprise that is using the software, rather than the service provider. This extends to ongoing
    management and updates, as some Platform as a Service (PaaS) only extend to the operating
    system, so patching and updating hosted applications are under the responsibility of the
    enterprise.</p>
   <p>Even after a strong initial configuration is developed and applied, it must be continually
    managed to avoid degrading security as software is updated or patched, new security
    vulnerabilities are reported, and configurations are “tweaked,” to allow the installation of new
    software or to support new operational requirements.</p>

    environment. There are many ways to covertly obtain access to user accounts, including: weak
    passwords, accounts still valid after a user leaves the enterprise, dormant or lingering test
    accounts, shared accounts that have not been changed in months or years, service accounts
    embedded in applications for scripts, a user having the same password as one they use for an
    online account that has been compromised (in a public password dump), social engineering a user
    to give their password, or using malware to capture passwords or tokens in memory or over the
    network.</p>
   <p>Administrative, or highly privileged, accounts are a particular target, because they allow
    attackers to add other accounts, or make changes to assets that could make them more vulnerable
    to other attacks. Service accounts are also sensitive, as they are often shared among teams,
    internal and external to the enterprise, and sometimes not known about, only to be revealed in
    standard account management audits.</p>
   <p>Finally, account logging and monitoring is a critical component of security operations. While
    account logging and monitoring are covered in CIS Control 8 (Audit Log Management), it is
    important in the development of a comprehensive Identity and Access Management (IAM)
    program.</p>

  </part>
  <part name="guidance" id="cisc-6_gdn">
   <p>Where CIS Control 5 deals specifically with account management, CIS Control 6 focuses on
    managing what access these accounts have, ensuring users only have access to the data or
    enterprise assets appropriate for their role, and ensuring that there is strong authentication
    for critical or sensitive enterprise data or functions. Accounts should only have the minimal
    authorization needed for the role. Developing consistent access rights for each role and
    assigning roles to users is a best practice. Developing a program for complete provision and
    de-provisioning access is also important. Centralizing this function is ideal.</p>
   <p>There are some user activities that pose greater risk to an enterprise, either because they
    are accessed from untrusted networks, or performing administrator functions that allow the
    ability to add, change, or remove other accounts, or make configuration changes to operating
    systems or applications to make them less secure. This also enforces the importance of using MFA
    and Privileged Access Management (PAM) tools.</p>
   <p>Some users have access to enterprise assets or data they do not need for their role; this
    might be due to an immature process that gives all users all access, or lingering access as
    users change roles within the enterprise over time. Local administrator privileges to users’
    laptops is also an issue, as any malicious code installed or downloaded by the user can have
    greater impact on the enterprise asset running as administrator. User, administrator, and
    service account access should be based on enterprise role and need.</p>

   <p>Develop a plan to continuously assess and track vulnerabilities on all enterprise assets

  </part>
  <part name="guidance" id="cisc-7_gdn">
   <p>Cyber defenders are constantly being challenged from attackers who are looking for
    vulnerabilities within their infrastructure to exploit and gain access. Defenders must have
    timely threat information available to them about: software updates, patches, security
    advisories, threat bulletins, etc., and they should regularly review their environment to
    identify these vulnerabilities before the attackers do. Understanding and managing
    vulnerabilities is a continuous activity, requiring focus of time, attention, and resources.</p>
   <p>Attackers have access to the same information and can often take advantage of vulnerabilities
    more quickly than an enterprise can remediate. While there is a gap in time from a vulnerability
    being known to when it is patched, defenders can prioritize which vulnerabilities are most
    impactful to the enterprise, or likely to be exploited first due to ease of use. For example,
    when researchers or the community report new vulnerabilities, vendors have to develop and deploy
    patches, indicators of compromise (IOCs), and updates. Defenders need to assess the risk of the
    new vulnerability to the enterprise, regression-test patches , and install the patch.</p>
   <p>There is never perfection in this process. Attackers might be using an exploit to a
    vulnerability that is not known within the security community. They might have developed an
    exploit to this vulnerability referred to as a “zero-day” exploit. Once the vulnerability is
    known in the community, the process mentioned above starts. Therefore, defenders must keep in
    mind that an exploit might already exist when the vulnerability is widely socialized. Sometimes
    vulnerabilities might be known within a closed community (e.g., vendor still developing a fix)
    for weeks, months, or years before it is disclosed publicly. Defenders have to be aware that
    there might always be vulnerabilities they cannot remediate, and therefore need to use other
    controls to mitigate.</p>
   <p>Enterprises that do not assess their infrastructure for vulnerabilities and proactively
    address discovered flaws face a significant likelihood of having their enterprise assets
    compromised. Defenders face particular challenges in scaling remediation across an entire
    enterprise, and prioritizing actions with conflicting priorities, while not impacting the
    enterprise’s business or mission.</p>

  </part>
  <part name="guidance" id="cisc-8_gdn">
   <p>Log collection and analysis is critical for an enterprise’s ability to detect malicious
    activity quickly. Sometimes audit records are the only evidence of a successful attack.
    Attackers know that many enterprises keep audit logs for compliance purposes, but rarely analyze
    them. Attackers use this knowledge to hide their location, malicious software, and activities on
    victim machines. Due to poor or nonexistent log analysis processes, attackers sometimes control
    victim machines for months or years without anyone in the target enterprise knowing.</p>
   <p>There are two types of logs that are generally treated and often configured independently:
    system logs and audit logs. System logs typically provide system-level events that show various
    system process start/end times, crashes, etc. These are native to systems, and take less
    configuration to turn on. Audit logs typically include user-level events – when a user logged
    in, accessed a file, etc. – and take more planning and effort to set up.</p>
   <p>Logging records are also critical for incident response. After an attack has been detected,
    log analysis can help enterprises understand the extent of an attack. Complete logging records
    can show, for example, when and how the attack occurred, what information was accessed, and if
    data was exfiltrated. Retention of logs is also critical in case a follow-up investigation is
    required or if an attack remained undetected for a long period of time.</p>

   <p>Web browsers and email clients are very common points of entry for attackers because of their

    the main means that users interact with external and untrusted users and environments, these are

   <p>Establish and maintain data recovery practices sufficient to restore in-scope enterprise
    assets to a pre-incident and trusted state.</p>
  </part>
  <part name="guidance" id="cisc-11_gdn">
   <p>In the cybersecurity triad – Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability (CIA) – the
    availability of data is, in some cases, more critical than its confidentiality. Enterprises need
    many types of data to make business decisions, and when that data is not available or is
    untrusted, then it could impact the enterprise. An easy example is weather information to a
    transportation enterprise.</p>
   <p>When attackers compromise assets, they make changes to configurations, add accounts, and often
    add software or scripts. These changes are not always easy to identify, as attackers might have
    corrupted or replaced trusted applications with malicious versions, or the changes might appear
    to be standard-looking account names. Configuration changes can include adding or changing
    registry entries, opening ports, turning off security services, deleting logs, or other
    malicious actions that make a system insecure. These actions do not have to be malicious; human
    error can cause each of these as well. Therefore, it is important to have an ability to have
    recent backups or mirrors to recover enterprise assets and data back to a known trusted
    state.</p>
   <p>There has been an exponential rise in ransomware over the last few years. It is not a new
    threat, though it has become more commercialized and organized as a reliable method for
    attackers to make money. If an attacker encrypts an enterprise’s data and demands ransom for its
    restoration, having a recent backup to recover to a known, trusted state can be helpful.
    However, as ransomware has evolved, it has also become an extortion technique, where data is
    exfiltrated before being encrypted, and the attacker asks for payment to restore the
    enterprise’s data, as well as to keep it from being sold or publicized. In this case,
    restoration would only solve the issue of restoring systems to a trusted state and continuing
    operations. Leveraging the guidance within the CIS Controls will help reduce the risk of
    ransomware through improved cyber hygiene, as attackers usually use older or basic exploits on
    insecure systems.</p>

  </part>
  <part name="guidance" id="cisc-12_gdn">
   <p>Secure network infrastructure is an essential defense against attacks. This includes an
    appropriate security architecture, addressing vulnerabilities that are, often times, introduced
    with default settings, monitoring for changes, and reassessment of current configurations.
    Network infrastructure includes devices such as physical and virtualized gateways, firewalls,
    wireless access points, routers, and switches.</p>
   <p>Default configurations for network devices are geared for ease-of-deployment and ease-of-use –
    not security. Potential default vulnerabilities include open services and ports, default
    accounts and passwords (including service accounts), support for older vulnerable protocols, and
    pre-installation of unneeded software. Attackers search for vulnerable default settings, gaps or
    inconsistencies in firewall rule sets, routers, and switches and use those holes to penetrate
    defenses. They exploit flaws in these devices to gain access to networks, redirect traffic on a
    network, and intercept data while in transmission.</p>
   <p>Network security is a constantly changing environment that necessitates regular re-evaluation
    of architecture diagrams, configurations, access controls, and allowed traffic flows. Attackers
    take advantage of network device configurations becoming less secure over time as users demand
    exceptions for specific business needs. Sometimes the exceptions are deployed, but not removed
    when they are no longer applicable to the business’s needs. In some cases, the security risk of
    an exception is neither properly analyzed nor measured against the associated business need and
    can change over time.</p>

  </part>
  <part name="guidance" id="cisc-13_gdn">
   <p>We cannot rely on network defenses to be perfect. Adversaries continue to evolve and mature,
    as they share, or sell, information among their community on exploits and bypasses to security
    controls. Even if security tools work “as advertised,” it takes an understanding of the
    enterprise risk posture to configure, tune, and log them to be effective. Often,
    misconfigurations due to human error or lack of knowledge of tool capabilities give enterprises
    a false sense of security.</p>
   <p>Security tools can only be effective if they are supporting a process of continuous monitoring
    that allows staff the ability to be alerted and respond to security incidents quickly.
    Enterprises that adopt a purely technology-driven approach will also experience more false
    positives, due to their over-reliance on alerts from tools. Identifying and responding to these
    threats requires visibility into all threat vectors of the infrastructure and leveraging humans
    in the process of detection, analysis, and response. It is critical for large or heavily
    targeted enterprises to have a security operations capability to prevent, detect, and quickly
    respond to cyber threats before they can impact the enterprise. This process will generate
    activity reports and metrics that will help enhance security policies, and support regulatory
    compliance for many enterprises.</p>
   <p>As we have seen many times in the press, enterprises have been compromised for weeks, months,
    or years before discovery. The primary benefit of having comprehensive situational awareness is
    to increase the speed of detection and response. This is critical to respond quickly when
    malware is discovered, credentials are stolen, or when sensitive data is compromised to reduce
    impact to the enterprise.</p>
   <p>Through good situational awareness (i.e., security operations), enterprises will identify and
    catalog Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) of attackers, including their IOCs that will
    help the enterprise become more proactive in identifying future threats or incidents. Recovery
    can be achieved faster when the response has access to complete information about the
    environment and enterprise structure to develop efficient response strategies.</p>

  </part>
  <part name="guidance" id="cisc-14_gdn">
   <p>The actions of people play a critical part in the success or failure of an enterprise’s
    security program. It is easier for an attacker to entice a user to click a link or open an email
    attachment to install malware in order to get into an enterprise, than to find a network exploit
    to do it directly.</p>
   <p>Users themselves, both intentionally and unintentionally, can cause incidents as a result of
    mishandling sensitive data, sending an email with sensitive data to the wrong recipient, losing
    a portable end-user device, using weak passwords, or using the same password they use on public
    sites.</p>
   <p>No security program can effectively address cyber risk without a means to address this
    fundamental human vulnerability. Users at every level of the enterprise have different risks.
    For example: executives manage more sensitive data; system administrators have the ability to
    control access to systems and applications; and users in finance, human resources, and contracts
    all have access to different types of sensitive data that can make them targets.</p>
   <p>The training should be updated regularly. This will increase the culture of security and
    discourage risky workarounds.</p>

  <part name="guidance" id="cisc-15_gdn">
   <p>In our modern, connected world, enterprises rely on vendors and partners to help manage their
    data or rely on third-party infrastructure for core applications or functions.</p>
   <p>There have been numerous examples where third-party breaches have significantly impacted an
    enterprise; for example, as early as the late 2000s, payment cards were compromised after
    attackers infiltrated smaller third-party vendors in the retail industry. More recent examples
    include ransomware attacks that impact an enterprise indirectly, due to one of their service
    providers being locked down, causing disruption to business. Or worse, if directly connected, a
    ransomware attack could encrypt data on the main enterprise.</p>
   <p>Most data security and privacy regulations require their protection extend to third-party
    service providers, such as with Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)
    Business Associate agreements in healthcare, Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council
    (FFIEC) requirements for the financial industry, and the United Kingdom (U.K.) Cyber Essentials.
    Third-party trust is a core Governance Risk and Compliance (GRC) function, as risks that are not
    managed within the enterprise are transferred to entities outside the enterprise.</p>
   <p>While reviewing the security of third-parties has been a task performed for decades, there is
    not a universal standard for assessing security; and, many service providers are being audited
    by their customers multiple times a month, causing impacts to their own productivity. This is
    because every enterprise has a different “checklist” or set of standards to grade the service
    provider. There are only a few industry standards, such as in finance, with the Shared
    Assessments program, or in higher education, with their Higher Education Community Vendor
    Assessment Toolkit (HECVAT). Insurance companies selling cybersecurity policies also have their
    own measurements.</p>
   <p>While an enterprise might put a lot of scrutiny into large cloud or application hosting
    companies because they are hosting their email or critical business applications, smaller firms
    are often a greater risk. Often times, a third-party service provider contracts with additional
    parties to provide other plugins or services, such as when a third-party uses a fourth-party
    platform or product to support the main enterprise. </p>

   <p>Applications provide a human-friendly interface to allow users to access and manage data in a

    data, instead of an elaborate network and system hacking sequence, attempting to bypass network
    security controls and sensors. This is why protecting user credentials (specifically application
    credentials), defined in CIS Control 6, is so important.</p>
   <p>Lacking credentials, application flaws are the attack vector of choice. However, today’s
    applications are developed, operated, and maintained in a highly complex, diverse, and dynamic
    environment. Applications run on multiple platforms; web, mobile, cloud, etc., with application
    architectures that are more complex than legacy client-server or database-web server structures.
    Development life cycles have become shorter, transitioning from months or years in long
    waterfall methodologies, to DevOps cycles with frequent code updates. Also, applications are
    rarely created from scratch, and are often “assembled” from a complex mix of development
    frameworks, libraries, existing code, and new code. There are also modern and evolving data
    protection regulations dealing with user privacy. These may require compliance to regional or
    sector-specific data protection requirements.</p>
   <p>These factors make traditional approaches to security, like control (of processes, code
    sources, run-time environment, etc.), inspection, and testing, much more challenging. Also, the
    risk that an application vulnerability introduces might not be understood, except in a specific
    operational setting or context.</p>
   <p>Application vulnerabilities can be present for many reasons; insecure design, insecure
    infrastructure, coding mistakes, weak authentication, and failure to test for unusual or
    unexpected conditions. Attackers can exploit specific vulnerabilities, including buffer
    overflows, exposure to Structured Query Language (SQL) injection, cross-site scripting,
    cross-site request forgery, and click-jacking of code to gain access to sensitive data, or take
    control over vulnerable assets within the infrastructure as a launching point for further
    attacks.</p>
   <p>Applications and websites can also be used to harvest credentials, data, or attempt to install
    malware onto the users who access them.</p>
   <p>Finally, it is now more common to acquire Software as a Service (SaaS) platforms, where
    software is developed and managed entirely through a third-party. These might be hosted anywhere
    in the world. This brings challenges to enterprises who need to know what risks they are
    accepting with using these platforms; and they often do not have visibility into the development
    and application security practices of these platforms. Some of these SaaS platforms allow for
    customizing of their interfaces and databases. Enterprises who extend these applications should
    follow this CIS Control, similar to if they were doing ground-up customer development.</p>

  </part>
  <part name="guidance" id="cisc-17_gdn">
   <p>A comprehensive cybersecurity program includes protections, detections, response, and recovery
    capabilities. Often, the final two get overlooked in immature enterprises, or the response
    technique to compromised systems is just to re-image them to original state, and move on. The
    primary goal of incident response is to identify threats on the enterprise, respond to them
    before they can spread, and remediate them before they can cause harm. Without understanding the
    full scope of an incident, how it happened, and what can be done to prevent it from happening
    again, defenders will just be in a perpetual “whack-a-mole” pattern.</p>
   <p>We cannot expect our protections to be effective 100% of the time. When an incident occurs, if
    an enterprise does not have a documented plan – even with good people – it is almost impossible
    to know the right investigative procedures, reporting, data collection, management
    responsibility, legal protocols, and communications strategy that will allow the enterprise to
    successfully understand, manage, and recover.</p>
   <p>Along with detection, containment, and eradication, communication to stakeholders is key. If
    we are to reduce the probability of material impact due to a cyber event, the enterprise’s
    leadership must know what potential impact there could be, so that they can help prioritize
    remediation or restoration decisions that best support the enterprise. These business decisions
    could be based on regulatory compliance, disclosure rules, service-level agreements with
    partners or customers, revenue, or mission impacts.</p>
   <p>Dwell time from when an attack happens to when it is identified can be days, weeks, or months.
    The longer the attacker is in the enterprise’s infrastructure, the more embedded they become and
    they will develop more ways to maintain persistent access for when they are eventually
    discovered. With the rise of ransomware, which is a stable moneymaker for attackers, this dwell
    time is critical, especially with modern tactics of stealing data before encrypting it for

  <title>Penetration Testing</title>

   <p>Test the effectiveness and resiliency of enterprise assets through identifying and exploiting
    weaknesses in controls (people, processes, and technology), and simulating the objectives and
    actions of an attacker.</p>
  </part>
  <part name="guidance" id="cisc-18_gdn">
   <p>A successful defensive posture requires a comprehensive program of effective policies and
    governance, strong technical defenses, combined with appropriate action from people. However, it
    is rarely perfect. In a complex environment where technology is constantly evolving and new
    attacker tradecraft appears regularly, enterprises should periodically test their controls to
    identify gaps and to assess their resiliency. This test may be from external network, internal
    network, application, system, or device perspective. It may include social engineering of users,
    or physical access control bypasses.</p>
   <p>Often, penetration tests are performed for specific purposes: • As a “dramatic” demonstration
    of an attack, usually to convince decision-makers of their enterprise’s weaknesses • As a means
    to test the correct operation of enterprise defenses (“verification”) • To test that the
    enterprise has built the right defenses in the first place (“validation”)</p>
   <p>Independent penetration testing can provide valuable and objective insights about the
    existence of vulnerabilities in enterprise assets and humans, and the efficacy of defenses and
    mitigating controls to protect against adverse impacts to the enterprise. They are part of a
    comprehensive, ongoing program of security management and improvement. They can also reveal
    process weaknesses, such as incomplete or inconsistent configuration management, or end-user
    training.</p>
   <p>Penetration testing differs from vulnerability testing, described in CIS Control 7.
    Vulnerability testing just checks for presence of known, insecure enterprise assets, and stops
    there. Penetration testing goes further to exploit those weaknesses to see how far an attacker
    could get, and what business process or data might be impacted through exploitation of that
    vulnerability. This is an important detail, and often penetration testing and vulnerability
    testing are incorrectly used interchangeably. Vulnerability testing is exclusively automated
    scanning with sometimes manual validation of false positives, whereas penetration testing
    requires more human involvement and analysis, sometimes supported through the use of custom
    tools or scripts. However, vulnerability testing is often a starting point for a penetration
    test.</p>
   <p>Another common term is “Red Team” exercises. These are similar to penetration tests in that
    vulnerabilities are exploited; however, the difference is the focus. Red Teams simulate specific
    attacker TTPs to evaluate how an enterprise’s environment would withstand an attack from a
    specific adversary, or category of adversaries.</p>
