Managed control of all enterprise\nassets also plays a critical role in security monitoring, incident response, system backup, and\nrecovery. Enterprises should know what data is critical to them, and proper asset management\nwill help identify those enterprise assets that hold or manage this critical data, so\nappropriate security controls can be applied.\n\nExternal attackers are continuously scanning the internet address space of target enterprises,\npremise-based or in the cloud, identifying possibly unprotected assets attached to enterprises’\nnetworks. Attackers can take advantage of new assets that are installed, yet not securely\nconfigured and patched. Internally, unidentified assets can also have weak security\nconfigurations that can make them vulnerable to web or email-based malware; and adversaries can\nleverage weak security configurations for traversing the network, once they are inside.\n\nAdditional assets that connect to the enterprise’s network (e.g., demonstration systems,\ntemporary test systems, guest networks, etc.) should be identified and/or isolated, in order to\nprevent adversarial access from affecting the security of enterprise operations.\n\nLarge, complex, dynamic enterprises understandably struggle with the challenge of managing\nintricate, fast-changing environments. However, attackers have shown the ability, patience, and\nwillingness to \"inventory and control\" our enterprise assets at very large scale in order to\nsupport their opportunities.\n\nAnother challenge is that portable end-user devices will periodically join a network and then\ndisappear, making the inventory of currently available assets very dynamic. Likewise, cloud\nenvironments and virtual machines can be difficult to track in asset inventories when they are\nshut down or paused. Another benefit of complete enterprise asset management is supporting\nincident response. Both when investigating the origination of network traffic from an asset on\nthe network, and to be able to identify all potentially vulnerable, or impacted, assets of\nsimilar type or location during an incident."

Attackers\ncontinuously scan target enterprises looking for vulnerable versions of software that can be\nremotely exploited. For example, if a user opens a malicious website or attachment with a\nvulnerable browser, an attacker can often install backdoor programs and bots that give the\nattacker long-term control of the system. Attackers can also use this access to move laterally\nthrough the network. One of the key defenses against these attacks is updating and patching\nsoftware. However, without a complete inventory of software assets, an enterprise cannot\ndetermine if they have vulnerable software, or if there are potential licensing violations.\n\nEven if a patch is not yet available, a complete software inventory list allows an enterprise\nto guard against known attacks until the patch is released. Some sophisticated attackers use\n\"zero-day exploits\", which take advantage of previously unknown vulnerabilities that have yet to\nhave a patch released by the software vendor. Depending on the severity of the exploit, an\nenterprise can implement temporary mitigation measures to guard against attacks until the patch\nis released.\n\nManagement of software assets is also important to identify unnecessary security risks. An\nenterprise should review their software inventory to identify any enterprise assets running\nsoftware that is not needed for business purposes. For example, an enterprise asset may come\ninstalled with default software that creates a potential security risk and provides no benefit\nto the enterprise. It is critical to inventory, understand, assess, and manage all software\nconnected to an enterprise’s infrastructure."

In addition to sensitive data an\nenterprise holds related to finances, intellectual property, and customer data, there also might\nbe numerous international regulations for protection of personal data. Data privacy has become\nincreasingly important, and enterprises are learning that privacy is about the appropriate use\nand management of data, not just encryption. Data must be appropriately managed through its\nentire lifecycle. These privacy rules can be complicated for multi-national enterprises, of any\nsize, however there are fundamentals that can apply to all.\n\nOnce attackers have penetrated an enterprise’s infrastructure, one of their first tasks is to\nfind and exfiltrate data. Enterprises might not be aware that sensitive data is leaving their\nenvironment because they are not monitoring data outflows.\n\nWhile many attacks occur on the network, others involve physical theft of portable end-user\ndevices, attacks on service providers or other partners holding sensitive data. Other sensitive\nenterprise assets may also include non-computing devices that provide management and control of\nphysical systems, such as Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems.\n\nThe enterprise’s loss of control over protected or sensitive data is a serious and often\nreportable business impact. While some data is compromised or lost as a result of theft or\nespionage, the vast majority are a result of poorly understood data management rules, and user\nerror. The adoption of data encryption, both in transit and at rest, can provide mitigation\nagainst data compromise, and more importantly, is a regulatory requirement for most controlled\ndata."

They often are not set up by default in the most secure configuration to provide\nflexibility for their customers to apply their own security policies. Therefore, the presence of\ndefault accounts or passwords, excessive access, or unnecessary services are common in default\nconfigurations.

Defenders must have\ntimely threat information available to them about: software updates, patches, security\nadvisories, threat bulletins, etc., and they should regularly review their environment to\nidentify these vulnerabilities before the attackers do. Understanding and managing\nvulnerabilities is a continuous activity, requiring focus of time, attention, and resources.\n\nAttackers have access to the same information and can often take advantage of vulnerabilities\nmore quickly than an enterprise can remediate. While there is a gap in time from a vulnerability\nbeing known to when it is patched, defenders can prioritize which vulnerabilities are most\nimpactful to the enterprise, or likely to be exploited first due to ease of use. For example,\nwhen researchers or the community report new vulnerabilities, vendors have to develop and deploy\npatches, indicators of compromise (IOCs), and updates. Defenders need to assess the risk of the\nnew vulnerability to the enterprise, regression-test patches , and install the patch.\n\nThere is never perfection in this process. Attackers might be using an exploit to a\nvulnerability that is not known within the security community. They might have developed an\nexploit to this vulnerability referred to as a \"zero-day\" exploit. Once the vulnerability is\nknown in the community, the process mentioned above starts. Therefore, defenders must keep in\nmind that an exploit might already exist when the vulnerability is widely socialized. Sometimes\nvulnerabilities might be known within a closed community (e.g., vendor still developing a fix)\nfor weeks, months, or years before it is disclosed publicly. Defenders have to be aware that\nthere might always be vulnerabilities they cannot remediate, and therefore need to use other\ncontrols to mitigate.\n\nEnterprises that do not assess their infrastructure for vulnerabilities and proactively\naddress discovered flaws face a significant likelihood of having their enterprise assets\ncompromised. Defenders face particular challenges in scaling remediation across an entire\nenterprise, and prioritizing actions with conflicting priorities, while not impacting the\nenterprise’s business or mission."

Attackers use this knowledge to hide their location, malicious software, and activities on\nvictim machines. Due to poor or nonexistent log analysis processes, attackers sometimes control\nvictim machines for months or years without anyone in the target enterprise knowing.\n\nThere are two types of logs that are generally treated and often configured independently:\nsystem logs and audit logs. System logs typically provide system-level events that show various\nsystem process start/end times, crashes, etc. These are native to systems, and take less\nconfiguration to turn on. Audit logs typically include user-level events – when a user logged\nin, accessed a file, etc. – and take more planning and effort to set up.\n\nLogging records are also critical for incident response. After an attack has been detected,\nlog analysis can help enterprises understand the extent of an attack. Complete logging records\ncan show, for example, when and how the attack occurred, what information was accessed, and if\ndata was exfiltrated. Retention of logs is also critical in case a follow-up investigation is\nrequired or if an attack remained undetected for a long period of time."

Enterprises need\nmany types of data to make business decisions, and when that data is not available or is\nuntrusted, then it could impact the enterprise. An easy example is weather information to a\ntransportation enterprise.\n\nWhen attackers compromise assets, they make changes to configurations, add accounts, and often\nadd software or scripts. These changes are not always easy to identify, as attackers might have\ncorrupted or replaced trusted applications with malicious versions, or the changes might appear\nto be standard-looking account names. Configuration changes can include adding or changing\nregistry entries, opening ports, turning off security services, deleting logs, or other\nmalicious actions that make a system insecure. These actions do not have to be malicious; human\nerror can cause each of these as well. Therefore, it is important to have an ability to have\nrecent backups or mirrors to recover enterprise assets and data back to a known trusted\nstate.\n\nThere has been an exponential rise in ransomware over the last few years. It is not a new\nthreat, though it has become more commercialized and organized as a reliable method for\nattackers to make money. If an attacker encrypts an enterprise’s data and demands ransom for its\nrestoration, having a recent backup to recover to a known, trusted state can be helpful.\nHowever, as ransomware has evolved, it has also become an extortion technique, where data is\nexfiltrated before being encrypted, and the attacker asks for payment to restore the\nenterprise’s data, as well as to keep it from being sold or publicized. In this case,\nrestoration would only solve the issue of restoring systems to a trusted state and continuing\noperations. Leveraging the guidance within the CIS Controls will help reduce the risk of\nransomware through improved cyber hygiene, as attackers usually use older or basic exploits on\ninsecure systems."

Potential default vulnerabilities include open services and ports, default\naccounts and passwords (including service accounts), support for older vulnerable protocols, and\npre-installation of unneeded software. Attackers search for vulnerable default settings, gaps or\ninconsistencies in firewall rule sets, routers, and switches and use those holes to penetrate\ndefenses. They exploit flaws in these devices to gain access to networks, redirect traffic on a\nnetwork, and intercept data while in transmission.\n\nNetwork security is a constantly changing environment that necessitates regular re-evaluation\nof architecture diagrams, configurations, access controls, and allowed traffic flows. Attackers\ntake advantage of network device configurations becoming less secure over time as users demand\nexceptions for specific business needs. Sometimes the exceptions are deployed, but not removed\nwhen they are no longer applicable to the business’s needs.

Adversaries continue to evolve and mature,\nas they share, or sell, information among their community on exploits and bypasses to security\ncontrols. Even if security tools work \"as advertised,\" it takes an understanding of the\nenterprise risk posture to configure, tune, and log them to be effective. Often,\nmisconfigurations due to human error or lack of knowledge of tool capabilities give enterprises\na false sense of security.\n\nSecurity tools can only be effective if they are supporting a process of continuous monitoring\nthat allows staff the ability to be alerted and respond to security incidents quickly.\nEnterprises that adopt a purely technology-driven approach will also experience more false\npositives, due to their over-reliance on alerts from tools. Identifying and responding to these\nthreats requires visibility into all threat vectors of the infrastructure and leveraging humans\nin the process of detection, analysis, and response. It is critical for large or heavily\ntargeted enterprises to have a security operations capability to prevent, detect, and quickly\nrespond to cyber threats before they can impact the enterprise. This process will generate\nactivity reports and metrics that will help enhance security policies, and support regulatory\ncompliance for many enterprises.\n\nAs we have seen many times in the press, enterprises have been compromised for weeks, months,\nor years before discovery. The primary benefit of having comprehensive situational awareness is\nto increase the speed of detection and response. This is critical to respond quickly when\nmalware is discovered, credentials are stolen, or when sensitive data is compromised to reduce\nimpact to the enterprise.\n\nThrough good situational awareness (i.e., security operations), enterprises will identify and\ncatalog Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) of attackers, including their IOCs that will\nhelp the enterprise become more proactive in identifying future threats or incidents. Recovery\ncan be achieved faster when the response has access to complete information about the\nenvironment and enterprise structure to develop efficient response strategies."

More recent examples\ninclude ransomware attacks that impact an enterprise indirectly, due to one of their service\nproviders being locked down, causing disruption to business. Or worse, if directly connected, a\nransomware attack could encrypt data on the main enterprise.\n\nMost data security and privacy regulations require their protection extend to third-party\nservice providers, such as with Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)\nBusiness Associate agreements in healthcare, Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council\n(FFIEC) requirements for the financial industry, and the United Kingdom (U.K.) Cyber Essentials.\nThird-party trust is a core Governance Risk and Compliance (GRC) function, as risks that are not\nmanaged within the enterprise are transferred to entities outside the enterprise.\n\nWhile reviewing the security of third-parties has been a task performed for decades, there is\nnot a universal standard for assessing security; and, many service providers are being audited\nby their customers multiple times a month, causing impacts to their own productivity. This is\nbecause every enterprise has a different \"checklist\" or set of standards to grade the service\nprovider. There are only a few industry standards, such as in finance, with the Shared\nAssessments program, or in higher education, with their Higher Education Community Vendor\nAssessment Toolkit (HECVAT). Insurance companies selling cybersecurity policies also have their\nown measurements.\n\nWhile an enterprise might put a lot of scrutiny into large cloud or application hosting\ncompanies because they are hosting their email or critical business applications, smaller firms\nare often a greater risk. Often times, a third-party service provider contracts with additional\nparties to provide other plugins or services, such as when a third-party uses a fourth-party\nplatform or product to support the main enterprise."

This is why protecting user credentials (specifically application\ncredentials), defined in CIS Control 6, is so important.\n\nLacking credentials, application flaws are the attack vector of choice. However, today’s\napplications are developed, operated, and maintained in a highly complex, diverse, and dynamic\nenvironment. Applications run on multiple platforms; web, mobile, cloud, etc., with application\narchitectures that are more complex than legacy client-server or database-web server structures.\nDevelopment life cycles have become shorter, transitioning from months or years in long\nwaterfall methodologies, to DevOps cycles with frequent code updates. Also, applications are\nrarely created from scratch, and are often \"assembled\" from a complex mix of development\nframeworks, libraries, existing code, and new code. There are also modern and evolving data\nprotection regulations dealing with user privacy. These may require compliance to regional or\nsector-specific data protection requirements.\n\nThese factors make traditional approaches to security, like control (of processes, code\nsources, run-time environment, etc.), inspection, and testing, much more challenging. Also, the\nrisk that an application vulnerability introduces might not be understood, except in a specific\noperational setting or context.\n\nApplication vulnerabilities can be present for many reasons; insecure design, insecure\ninfrastructure, coding mistakes, weak authentication, and failure to test for unusual or\nunexpected conditions. Attackers can exploit specific vulnerabilities, including buffer\noverflows, exposure to Structured Query Language (SQL) injection, cross-site scripting,\ncross-site request forgery, and click-jacking of code to gain access to sensitive data, or take\ncontrol over vulnerable assets within the infrastructure as a launching point for further\nattacks.\n\nApplications and websites can also be used to harvest credentials, data, or attempt to install\nmalware onto the users who access them.\n\nFinally, it is now more common to acquire Software as a Service (SaaS) platforms, where\nsoftware is developed and managed entirely through a third-party. These might be hosted anywhere\nin the world. This brings challenges to enterprises who need to know what risks they are\naccepting with using these platforms; and they often do not have visibility into the development\nand application security practices of these platforms. Some of these SaaS platforms allow for\ncustomizing of their interfaces and databases. Enterprises who extend these applications should\nfollow this CIS Control, similar to if they were doing ground-up customer development."

However, it\nis rarely perfect. In a complex environment where technology is constantly evolving and new\nattacker tradecraft appears regularly, enterprises should periodically test their controls to\nidentify gaps and to assess their resiliency. This test may be from external network, internal\nnetwork, application, system, or device perspective. It may include social engineering of users,\nor physical access control bypasses.\n\nOften, penetration tests are performed for specific purposes: • As a \"dramatic\" demonstration\nof an attack, usually to convince decision-makers of their enterprise’s weaknesses • As a means\nto test the correct operation of enterprise defenses (\"verification\") • To test that the\nenterprise has built the right defenses in the first place (\"validation\")\n\nIndependent penetration testing can provide valuable and objective insights about the\nexistence of vulnerabilities in enterprise assets and humans, and the efficacy of defenses and\nmitigating controls to protect against adverse impacts to the enterprise. They are part of a\ncomprehensive, ongoing program of security management and improvement. They can also reveal\nprocess weaknesses, such as incomplete or inconsistent configuration management, or end-user\ntraining.\n\nPenetration testing differs from vulnerability testing, described in CIS Control 7.\nVulnerability testing just checks for presence of known, insecure enterprise assets, and stops\nthere. Penetration testing goes further to exploit those weaknesses to see how far an attacker\ncould get, and what business process or data might be impacted through exploitation of that\nvulnerability. This is an important detail, and often penetration testing and vulnerability\ntesting are incorrectly used interchangeably. Vulnerability testing is exclusively automated\nscanning with sometimes manual validation of false positives, whereas penetration testing\nrequires more human involvement and analysis, sometimes supported through the use of custom\ntools or scripts. However, vulnerability testing is often a starting point for a penetration\ntest.\n\nAnother common term is \"Red Team\" exercises. These are similar to penetration tests in that\nvulnerabilities are exploited; however, the difference is the focus. Red Teams simulate specific\nattacker TTPs to evaluate how an enterprise’s environment would withstand an attack from a\nspecific adversary, or category of adversaries."
