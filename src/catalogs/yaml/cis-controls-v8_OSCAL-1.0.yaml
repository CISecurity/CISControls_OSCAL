        Actively manage (inventory, track, and correct) all enterprise assets (end-user devices,
        including portable and mobile; network devices; non-computing/Internet of Things (IoT) devices;
        and servers) connected to the infrastructure, physically, virtually, remotely, and those within
        cloud environments, to accurately know the totality of assets that need to be monitored and
        protected within the enterprise. This will also support identifying unauthorized and unmanaged
        assets to remove or remediate.

      prose: |-
        Enterprises cannot defend what they do not know they have. Managed control of all enterprise
        assets also plays a critical role in security monitoring, incident response, system backup, and
        recovery. Enterprises should know what data is critical to them, and proper asset management
        will help identify those enterprise assets that hold or manage this critical data, so
        appropriate security controls can be applied.

        External attackers are continuously scanning the internet address space of target enterprises,
        premise-based or in the cloud, identifying possibly unprotected assets attached to enterprises’
        networks. Attackers can take advantage of new assets that are installed, yet not securely
        configured and patched. Internally, unidentified assets can also have weak security
        configurations that can make them vulnerable to web or email-based malware; and adversaries can
        leverage weak security configurations for traversing the network, once they are inside.

        Additional assets that connect to the enterprise’s network (e.g., demonstration systems,
        temporary test systems, guest networks, etc.) should be identified and/or isolated, in order to
        prevent adversarial access from affecting the security of enterprise operations.

        Large, complex, dynamic enterprises understandably struggle with the challenge of managing
        intricate, fast-changing environments. However, attackers have shown the ability, patience, and
        willingness to "inventory and control" our enterprise assets at very large scale in order to
        support their opportunities.

        Another challenge is that portable end-user devices will periodically join a network and then
        disappear, making the inventory of currently available assets very dynamic. Likewise, cloud
        environments and virtual machines can be difficult to track in asset inventories when they are
        shut down or paused. Another benefit of complete enterprise asset management is supporting
        incident response. Both when investigating the origination of network traffic from an asset on
        the network, and to be able to identify all potentially vulnerable, or impacted, assets of
        similar type or location during an incident.

      prose: |-
        A complete software inventory is a critical foundation for preventing attacks. Attackers
        continuously scan target enterprises looking for vulnerable versions of software that can be
        remotely exploited. For example, if a user opens a malicious website or attachment with a
        vulnerable browser, an attacker can often install backdoor programs and bots that give the
        attacker long-term control of the system. Attackers can also use this access to move laterally
        through the network. One of the key defenses against these attacks is updating and patching
        software. However, without a complete inventory of software assets, an enterprise cannot
        determine if they have vulnerable software, or if there are potential licensing violations.

        Even if a patch is not yet available, a complete software inventory list allows an enterprise
        to guard against known attacks until the patch is released. Some sophisticated attackers use
        "zero-day exploits", which take advantage of previously unknown vulnerabilities that have yet to
        have a patch released by the software vendor. Depending on the severity of the exploit, an
        enterprise can implement temporary mitigation measures to guard against attacks until the patch
        is released.

        Management of software assets is also important to identify unnecessary security risks. An
        enterprise should review their software inventory to identify any enterprise assets running
        software that is not needed for business purposes. For example, an enterprise asset may come
        installed with default software that creates a potential security risk and provides no benefit
        to the enterprise. It is critical to inventory, understand, assess, and manage all software
        connected to an enterprise’s infrastructure.

        increasingly important, and enterprises are learning that privacy is about the appropriate use
        and management of data, not just encryption. Data must be appropriately managed through its
        entire lifecycle. These privacy rules can be complicated for multi-national enterprises, of any
        size, however there are fundamentals that can apply to all.

        Once attackers have penetrated an enterprise’s infrastructure, one of their first tasks is to
        find and exfiltrate data. Enterprises might not be aware that sensitive data is leaving their
        environment because they are not monitoring data outflows.

        While many attacks occur on the network, others involve physical theft of portable end-user
        devices, attacks on service providers or other partners holding sensitive data. Other sensitive
        enterprise assets may also include non-computing devices that provide management and control of
        physical systems, such as Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems.

        The enterprise’s loss of control over protected or sensitive data is a serious and often
        reportable business impact. While some data is compromised or lost as a result of theft or
        espionage, the vast majority are a result of poorly understood data management rules, and user
        error. The adoption of data encryption, both in transit and at rest, can provide mitigation
        against data compromise, and more importantly, is a regulatory requirement for most controlled
        data.

      prose: |-
        As delivered from manufacturers and resellers, the default configurations for enterprise
        assets and software are normally geared towards ease-of-deployment and ease-of-use rather than
        security. Basic controls, open services and ports, default accounts or passwords, pre-configured
        Domain Name System (DNS) settings, older (vulnerable) protocols, and pre-installation of
        unnecessary software can all be exploitable if left in their default state. Further, these
        security configuration updates need to be managed and maintained over the life cycle of
        enterprise assets and software. Configuration updates need to be tracked and approved through
        configuration management workflow process to maintain a record that can be reviewed for
        compliance, leveraged for incident response, and to support audits. This CIS Control is
        important to on-premises devices, as well as remote devices, network devices, and cloud
        environments.

        Service providers play a key role in modern infrastructures, especially for smaller
        enterprises. They often are not set up by default in the most secure configuration to provide
        flexibility for their customers to apply their own security policies. Therefore, the presence of
        default accounts or passwords, excessive access, or unnecessary services are common in default
        configurations. These could introduce weaknesses that are under the responsibility of the
        enterprise that is using the software, rather than the service provider. This extends to ongoing
        management and updates, as some Platform as a Service (PaaS) only extend to the operating
        system, so patching and updating hosted applications are under the responsibility of the
        enterprise.

        Even after a strong initial configuration is developed and applied, it must be continually
        managed to avoid degrading security as software is updated or patched, new security
        vulnerabilities are reported, and configurations are "tweaked," to allow the installation of new
        software or to support new operational requirements.

      prose: |-
        It is easier for an external or internal threat actor to gain unauthorized access to
        enterprise assets or data through using valid user credentials than through "hacking" the
        environment. There are many ways to covertly obtain access to user accounts, including: weak
        passwords, accounts still valid after a user leaves the enterprise, dormant or lingering test
        accounts, shared accounts that have not been changed in months or years, service accounts
        embedded in applications for scripts, a user having the same password as one they use for an
        online account that has been compromised (in a public password dump), social engineering a user
        to give their password, or using malware to capture passwords or tokens in memory or over the
        network.

        Administrative, or highly privileged, accounts are a particular target, because they allow
        attackers to add other accounts, or make changes to assets that could make them more vulnerable
        to other attacks. Service accounts are also sensitive, as they are often shared among teams,
        internal and external to the enterprise, and sometimes not known about, only to be revealed in
        standard account management audits.

        Finally, account logging and monitoring is a critical component of security operations. While
        account logging and monitoring are covered in CIS Control 8 (Audit Log Management), it is
        important in the development of a comprehensive Identity and Access Management (IAM)
        program.

        Where CIS Control 5 deals specifically with account management, CIS Control 6 focuses on
        managing what access these accounts have, ensuring users only have access to the data or
        enterprise assets appropriate for their role, and ensuring that there is strong authentication
        for critical or sensitive enterprise data or functions. Accounts should only have the minimal
        authorization needed for the role. Developing consistent access rights for each role and
        assigning roles to users is a best practice. Developing a program for complete provision and
        de-provisioning access is also important. Centralizing this function is ideal.

        There are some user activities that pose greater risk to an enterprise, either because they
        are accessed from untrusted networks, or performing administrator functions that allow the
        ability to add, change, or remove other accounts, or make configuration changes to operating
        systems or applications to make them less secure. This also enforces the importance of using MFA
        and Privileged Access Management (PAM) tools.

        Some users have access to enterprise assets or data they do not need for their role; this
        might be due to an immature process that gives all users all access, or lingering access as
        users change roles within the enterprise over time. Local administrator privileges to users’
        laptops is also an issue, as any malicious code installed or downloaded by the user can have
        greater impact on the enterprise asset running as administrator. User, administrator, and
        service account access should be based on enterprise role and need.

    - id: cisc-7_gdn
      name: guidance
      prose: |-
        Cyber defenders are constantly being challenged from attackers who are looking for
        vulnerabilities within their infrastructure to exploit and gain access. Defenders must have
        timely threat information available to them about: software updates, patches, security
        advisories, threat bulletins, etc., and they should regularly review their environment to
        identify these vulnerabilities before the attackers do. Understanding and managing
        vulnerabilities is a continuous activity, requiring focus of time, attention, and resources.

        Attackers have access to the same information and can often take advantage of vulnerabilities
        more quickly than an enterprise can remediate. While there is a gap in time from a vulnerability
        being known to when it is patched, defenders can prioritize which vulnerabilities are most
        impactful to the enterprise, or likely to be exploited first due to ease of use. For example,
        when researchers or the community report new vulnerabilities, vendors have to develop and deploy
        patches, indicators of compromise (IOCs), and updates. Defenders need to assess the risk of the
        new vulnerability to the enterprise, regression-test patches , and install the patch.

        There is never perfection in this process. Attackers might be using an exploit to a
        vulnerability that is not known within the security community. They might have developed an
        exploit to this vulnerability referred to as a "zero-day" exploit. Once the vulnerability is
        known in the community, the process mentioned above starts. Therefore, defenders must keep in
        mind that an exploit might already exist when the vulnerability is widely socialized. Sometimes
        vulnerabilities might be known within a closed community (e.g., vendor still developing a fix)
        for weeks, months, or years before it is disclosed publicly. Defenders have to be aware that
        there might always be vulnerabilities they cannot remediate, and therefore need to use other
        controls to mitigate.

        Enterprises that do not assess their infrastructure for vulnerabilities and proactively
        address discovered flaws face a significant likelihood of having their enterprise assets
        compromised. Defenders face particular challenges in scaling remediation across an entire
        enterprise, and prioritizing actions with conflicting priorities, while not impacting the
        enterprise’s business or mission.

      prose: |-
        Log collection and analysis is critical for an enterprise’s ability to detect malicious
        activity quickly. Sometimes audit records are the only evidence of a successful attack.
        Attackers know that many enterprises keep audit logs for compliance purposes, but rarely analyze
        them. Attackers use this knowledge to hide their location, malicious software, and activities on
        victim machines. Due to poor or nonexistent log analysis processes, attackers sometimes control
        victim machines for months or years without anyone in the target enterprise knowing.

        There are two types of logs that are generally treated and often configured independently:
        system logs and audit logs. System logs typically provide system-level events that show various
        system process start/end times, crashes, etc. These are native to systems, and take less
        configuration to turn on. Audit logs typically include user-level events – when a user logged
        in, accessed a file, etc. – and take more planning and effort to set up.

        Logging records are also critical for incident response. After an attack has been detected,
        log analysis can help enterprises understand the extent of an attack. Complete logging records
        can show, for example, when and how the attack occurred, what information was accessed, and if
        data was exfiltrated. Retention of logs is also critical in case a follow-up investigation is
        required or if an attack remained undetected for a long period of time.

        Web browsers and email clients are very common points of entry for attackers because of their
        direct interaction with users inside an enterprise. Content can be crafted to entice or spoof
        users into disclosing credentials, providing sensitive data, or providing an open channel to
        allow attackers to gain access, thus increasing risk to the enterprise. Since email and web are
        the main means that users interact with external and untrusted users and environments, these are
        prime targets for both malicious code and social engineering. Additionally, as enterprises move
        to web-based email, or mobile email access, users no longer use traditional full-featured email
        clients, which provide embedded security controls like connection encryption, strong
        authentication, and phishing reporting buttons.

        Malicious software (sometimes categorized as viruses or Trojans) is an integral and dangerous
        aspect of internet threats. They can have many purposes, from capturing credentials, stealing
        data, identifying other targets within the network, and encrypting or destroying data. Malware
        is ever-evolving and adaptive, as modern variants leverage machine learning techniques.

        Malware enters an enterprise through vulnerabilities within the enterprise on end-user
        devices, email attachments, webpages, cloud services, mobile devices, and removable media.
        Malware often relies on insecure end-user behavior, such as clicking links, opening attachments,
        installing software or profiles, or inserting Universal Serial Bus (USB) flash drives. Modern
        malware is designed to avoid, deceive, or disable defenses.

        Malware defenses must be able to operate in this dynamic environment through automation,
        timely and rapid updating, and integration with other processes like vulnerability management
        and incident response. They must be deployed at all possible entry points and enterprise assets
        to detect, prevent spread, or control the execution of malicious software or code.

    - id: cisc-11_gdn
      name: guidance
      prose: |-
        In the cybersecurity triad – Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability (CIA) – the
        availability of data is, in some cases, more critical than its confidentiality. Enterprises need
        many types of data to make business decisions, and when that data is not available or is
        untrusted, then it could impact the enterprise. An easy example is weather information to a
        transportation enterprise.

        When attackers compromise assets, they make changes to configurations, add accounts, and often
        add software or scripts. These changes are not always easy to identify, as attackers might have
        corrupted or replaced trusted applications with malicious versions, or the changes might appear
        to be standard-looking account names. Configuration changes can include adding or changing
        registry entries, opening ports, turning off security services, deleting logs, or other
        malicious actions that make a system insecure. These actions do not have to be malicious; human
        error can cause each of these as well. Therefore, it is important to have an ability to have
        recent backups or mirrors to recover enterprise assets and data back to a known trusted
        state.

        There has been an exponential rise in ransomware over the last few years. It is not a new
        threat, though it has become more commercialized and organized as a reliable method for
        attackers to make money. If an attacker encrypts an enterprise’s data and demands ransom for its
        restoration, having a recent backup to recover to a known, trusted state can be helpful.
        However, as ransomware has evolved, it has also become an extortion technique, where data is
        exfiltrated before being encrypted, and the attacker asks for payment to restore the
        enterprise’s data, as well as to keep it from being sold or publicized. In this case,
        restoration would only solve the issue of restoring systems to a trusted state and continuing
        operations. Leveraging the guidance within the CIS Controls will help reduce the risk of

      prose: |-
        Secure network infrastructure is an essential defense against attacks. This includes an
        appropriate security architecture, addressing vulnerabilities that are, often times, introduced
        with default settings, monitoring for changes, and reassessment of current configurations.
        Network infrastructure includes devices such as physical and virtualized gateways, firewalls,
        wireless access points, routers, and switches.

        Default configurations for network devices are geared for ease-of-deployment and ease-of-use –
        not security. Potential default vulnerabilities include open services and ports, default
        accounts and passwords (including service accounts), support for older vulnerable protocols, and
        pre-installation of unneeded software. Attackers search for vulnerable default settings, gaps or
        inconsistencies in firewall rule sets, routers, and switches and use those holes to penetrate
        defenses. They exploit flaws in these devices to gain access to networks, redirect traffic on a
        network, and intercept data while in transmission.

        Network security is a constantly changing environment that necessitates regular re-evaluation
        of architecture diagrams, configurations, access controls, and allowed traffic flows. Attackers
        take advantage of network device configurations becoming less secure over time as users demand
        exceptions for specific business needs. Sometimes the exceptions are deployed, but not removed
        when they are no longer applicable to the business’s needs. In some cases, the security risk of
        an exception is neither properly analyzed nor measured against the associated business need and
        can change over time.

      name: guidance
      prose: |-
        We cannot rely on network defenses to be perfect. Adversaries continue to evolve and mature,
        as they share, or sell, information among their community on exploits and bypasses to security
        controls. Even if security tools work "as advertised," it takes an understanding of the
        enterprise risk posture to configure, tune, and log them to be effective. Often,
        misconfigurations due to human error or lack of knowledge of tool capabilities give enterprises
        a false sense of security.

        Security tools can only be effective if they are supporting a process of continuous monitoring
        that allows staff the ability to be alerted and respond to security incidents quickly.
        Enterprises that adopt a purely technology-driven approach will also experience more false
        positives, due to their over-reliance on alerts from tools. Identifying and responding to these
        threats requires visibility into all threat vectors of the infrastructure and leveraging humans
        in the process of detection, analysis, and response. It is critical for large or heavily
        targeted enterprises to have a security operations capability to prevent, detect, and quickly
        respond to cyber threats before they can impact the enterprise. This process will generate
        activity reports and metrics that will help enhance security policies, and support regulatory
        compliance for many enterprises.

        As we have seen many times in the press, enterprises have been compromised for weeks, months,
        or years before discovery. The primary benefit of having comprehensive situational awareness is
        to increase the speed of detection and response. This is critical to respond quickly when
        malware is discovered, credentials are stolen, or when sensitive data is compromised to reduce
        impact to the enterprise.

        Through good situational awareness (i.e., security operations), enterprises will identify and
        catalog Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) of attackers, including their IOCs that will
        help the enterprise become more proactive in identifying future threats or incidents. Recovery
        can be achieved faster when the response has access to complete information about the
        environment and enterprise structure to develop efficient response strategies.

      name: guidance
      prose: |-
        The actions of people play a critical part in the success or failure of an enterprise’s
        security program. It is easier for an attacker to entice a user to click a link or open an email
        attachment to install malware in order to get into an enterprise, than to find a network exploit
        to do it directly.

        Users themselves, both intentionally and unintentionally, can cause incidents as a result of
        mishandling sensitive data, sending an email with sensitive data to the wrong recipient, losing
        a portable end-user device, using weak passwords, or using the same password they use on public
        sites.

        No security program can effectively address cyber risk without a means to address this
        fundamental human vulnerability. Users at every level of the enterprise have different risks.
        For example: executives manage more sensitive data; system administrators have the ability to
        control access to systems and applications; and users in finance, human resources, and contracts
        all have access to different types of sensitive data that can make them targets.

        The training should be updated regularly. This will increase the culture of security and
        discourage risky workarounds.

      prose: |-
        In our modern, connected world, enterprises rely on vendors and partners to help manage their
        data or rely on third-party infrastructure for core applications or functions.

        There have been numerous examples where third-party breaches have significantly impacted an
        enterprise; for example, as early as the late 2000s, payment cards were compromised after
        attackers infiltrated smaller third-party vendors in the retail industry. More recent examples
        include ransomware attacks that impact an enterprise indirectly, due to one of their service
        providers being locked down, causing disruption to business. Or worse, if directly connected, a
        ransomware attack could encrypt data on the main enterprise.

        Most data security and privacy regulations require their protection extend to third-party
        service providers, such as with Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)
        Business Associate agreements in healthcare, Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council
        (FFIEC) requirements for the financial industry, and the United Kingdom (U.K.) Cyber Essentials.
        Third-party trust is a core Governance Risk and Compliance (GRC) function, as risks that are not
        managed within the enterprise are transferred to entities outside the enterprise.

        While reviewing the security of third-parties has been a task performed for decades, there is
        not a universal standard for assessing security; and, many service providers are being audited
        by their customers multiple times a month, causing impacts to their own productivity. This is
        because every enterprise has a different "checklist" or set of standards to grade the service
        provider. There are only a few industry standards, such as in finance, with the Shared
        Assessments program, or in higher education, with their Higher Education Community Vendor
        Assessment Toolkit (HECVAT). Insurance companies selling cybersecurity policies also have their
        own measurements.

        While an enterprise might put a lot of scrutiny into large cloud or application hosting
        companies because they are hosting their email or critical business applications, smaller firms
        are often a greater risk. Often times, a third-party service provider contracts with additional
        parties to provide other plugins or services, such as when a third-party uses a fourth-party
        platform or product to support the main enterprise.

        Applications provide a human-friendly interface to allow users to access and manage data in a

        directly with complex (and potentially error-prone) system functions, like logging into a
        database to insert or modify files. Enterprises use applications to manage their most sensitive
        data and control access to system resources, and so an attacker can use the application itself
        to compromise the data, instead of an elaborate network and system hacking sequence, attempting

        (specifically application credentials), defined in CIS Control 6, is so important.Applications

        security controls and sensors. This is why protecting user credentials (specifically application
        credentials), defined in CIS Control 6, is so important.

        Lacking credentials, application flaws are the attack vector of choice. However, today’s
        applications are developed, operated, and maintained in a highly complex, diverse, and dynamic
        environment. Applications run on multiple platforms; web, mobile, cloud, etc., with application
        architectures that are more complex than legacy client-server or database-web server structures.
        Development life cycles have become shorter, transitioning from months or years in long
        waterfall methodologies, to DevOps cycles with frequent code updates. Also, applications are
        rarely created from scratch, and are often "assembled" from a complex mix of development
        frameworks, libraries, existing code, and new code. There are also modern and evolving data
        protection regulations dealing with user privacy. These may require compliance to regional or
        sector-specific data protection requirements.

        These factors make traditional approaches to security, like control (of processes, code
        sources, run-time environment, etc.), inspection, and testing, much more challenging. Also, the
        risk that an application vulnerability introduces might not be understood, except in a specific
        operational setting or context.

        Application vulnerabilities can be present for many reasons; insecure design, insecure
        infrastructure, coding mistakes, weak authentication, and failure to test for unusual or
        unexpected conditions. Attackers can exploit specific vulnerabilities, including buffer
        overflows, exposure to Structured Query Language (SQL) injection, cross-site scripting,
        cross-site request forgery, and click-jacking of code to gain access to sensitive data, or take
        control over vulnerable assets within the infrastructure as a launching point for further
        attacks.

        Applications and websites can also be used to harvest credentials, data, or attempt to install
        malware onto the users who access them.

        Finally, it is now more common to acquire Software as a Service (SaaS) platforms, where
        software is developed and managed entirely through a third-party. These might be hosted anywhere
        in the world. This brings challenges to enterprises who need to know what risks they are
        accepting with using these platforms; and they often do not have visibility into the development
        and application security practices of these platforms. Some of these SaaS platforms allow for
        customizing of their interfaces and databases. Enterprises who extend these applications should
        follow this CIS Control, similar to if they were doing ground-up customer development.

      prose: |-
        A comprehensive cybersecurity program includes protections, detections, response, and recovery
        capabilities. Often, the final two get overlooked in immature enterprises, or the response
        technique to compromised systems is just to re-image them to original state, and move on. The
        primary goal of incident response is to identify threats on the enterprise, respond to them
        before they can spread, and remediate them before they can cause harm. Without understanding the
        full scope of an incident, how it happened, and what can be done to prevent it from happening
        again, defenders will just be in a perpetual "whack-a-mole" pattern.

        We cannot expect our protections to be effective 100% of the time. When an incident occurs, if
        an enterprise does not have a documented plan – even with good people – it is almost impossible
        to know the right investigative procedures, reporting, data collection, management
        responsibility, legal protocols, and communications strategy that will allow the enterprise to
        successfully understand, manage, and recover.

        Along with detection, containment, and eradication, communication to stakeholders is key. If
        we are to reduce the probability of material impact due to a cyber event, the enterprise’s
        leadership must know what potential impact there could be, so that they can help prioritize
        remediation or restoration decisions that best support the enterprise. These business decisions
        could be based on regulatory compliance, disclosure rules, service-level agreements with
        partners or customers, revenue, or mission impacts.

        Dwell time from when an attack happens to when it is identified can be days, weeks, or months.
        The longer the attacker is in the enterprise’s infrastructure, the more embedded they become and
        they will develop more ways to maintain persistent access for when they are eventually
        discovered. With the rise of ransomware, which is a stable moneymaker for attackers, this dwell
        time is critical, especially with modern tactics of stealing data before encrypting it for
        ransom.

      prose: |-
        A successful defensive posture requires a comprehensive program of effective policies and
        governance, strong technical defenses, combined with appropriate action from people. However, it
        is rarely perfect. In a complex environment where technology is constantly evolving and new
        attacker tradecraft appears regularly, enterprises should periodically test their controls to
        identify gaps and to assess their resiliency. This test may be from external network, internal
        network, application, system, or device perspective. It may include social engineering of users,
        or physical access control bypasses.

        Often, penetration tests are performed for specific purposes: • As a "dramatic" demonstration
        of an attack, usually to convince decision-makers of their enterprise’s weaknesses • As a means
        to test the correct operation of enterprise defenses ("verification") • To test that the
        enterprise has built the right defenses in the first place ("validation")

        Independent penetration testing can provide valuable and objective insights about the
        existence of vulnerabilities in enterprise assets and humans, and the efficacy of defenses and
        mitigating controls to protect against adverse impacts to the enterprise. They are part of a
        comprehensive, ongoing program of security management and improvement. They can also reveal
        process weaknesses, such as incomplete or inconsistent configuration management, or end-user
        training.

        Penetration testing differs from vulnerability testing, described in CIS Control 7.
        Vulnerability testing just checks for presence of known, insecure enterprise assets, and stops
        there. Penetration testing goes further to exploit those weaknesses to see how far an attacker
        could get, and what business process or data might be impacted through exploitation of that
        vulnerability. This is an important detail, and often penetration testing and vulnerability
        testing are incorrectly used interchangeably. Vulnerability testing is exclusively automated
        scanning with sometimes manual validation of false positives, whereas penetration testing
        requires more human involvement and analysis, sometimes supported through the use of custom
        tools or scripts. However, vulnerability testing is often a starting point for a penetration
        test.

        Another common term is "Red Team" exercises. These are similar to penetration tests in that
        vulnerabilities are exploited; however, the difference is the focus. Red Teams simulate specific
        attacker TTPs to evaluate how an enterprise’s environment would withstand an attack from a
        specific adversary, or category of adversaries.
